Why use atem?
-------------

 - Very portable, should work on any system.
 - Works for many metastock flavors (Equis, Norgate, stooq.com,
   bbfinance.com, etc.)
 - It's fast, factor 15-20 compared with the well known "ms2asc".
 - Support of EMaster files. Most other tools are just ignoring them which
   may results in wrong dates and loss of symbol descriptions.
 - Simple but powerful command line interface.
 - BSD open source license.

Installation
------------

Building from source requires a C++ compiler, like gcc/g++, clang/clang++
or icc/icpc. On Windows you could use cygwin or mingw.

Build from tar tarball works as usually:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

When building from git checkout you also need autoconf and gengetopt and don't
forget to type "autoreconf -vfi" first.


Usage
-----

By default atem reads metastock data from the current or given directory and
writes complete time series to stdout. Comma separated like this

$ atem -F, /path/to/msdata
